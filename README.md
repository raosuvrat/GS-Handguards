# GS-Handguards
## 3d mesh of OEM BMW 700/750/800/850 Handguards
Mirror part for the left handguard.
Some deformities near base of model since this was scanned; found it easier to sand them off than to edit the mesh.
Will need to be split to comfortably fit in the print volumes of most 3d printers.
Printable without supports if you're clever about where to split and orientation. Use a brim or raft.
